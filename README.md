# Epilepsy-Detection-system
This project is a Final project at B.s.c of electrical engineering course in HIT- by dr' Belberg Michal.
# Project details
This project describes an experiment about epilepsy detection system using EEG siganls with low channels count.
The system develop on entropy & energy features with machine learning classifiers SVM, KNN and LDA (the algorithm based on [article.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6147694/)

create system that detect epilepsy seizures in EEG signals using matlab.

the goal is develop system that use low number of channels and detect seizures in real time.
